% spatial tuning by spatial information - DONE

% coverage of the environment - DONE

% temporal cross-correlation for stability of place coding

% Multivariate model for 2D(non-linear Poisson, or even just GLM)
    % position - DONE
    % head direction - DONE
        % check rate preference for each quadrant
    % egocentric boundary - DONE
    % gridness/spatial autocorrelation (Brandon, 2011)
    
    % For 3D - add
        % COM/head height
        % angular velocity
        % head tilt
        % azimuth head direction

% nonlocal spatial code (Dotson, 2021)

% is 3D really 3D or just layered 2D
